# Naming
## Classes & Objects
```
Class names should be written in PascalCase and are typically nouns and noun phrases.
e.g. Number or Character.

On the other hand, Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases e.g. Map, but sometime they can be adjectives or adjective phrases 
e.g. Closeable

Test classes are named starting with the class name of the class they are testing and ended by with Test.
e.g. : LoginActivityTest or LoginPresenterTest
```
